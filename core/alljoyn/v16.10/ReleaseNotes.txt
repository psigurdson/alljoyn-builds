             slow discovery of clients when in noisy (lots of clients)
             enviroments (100 so devices advertising) - a charaterization effort
             is planned in 17.04 timeframe.
ASACORE-3276 ASACORE-3283 [IPNS][Fix] Query responses are sent when shouldn't
ASACORE-3298 openwrt SConscript loads the environment variable "TARGET_LDFLAGS"

             using the GTEST unit test framework for AllJoyn.)

Compatibility
-------------
Version 16.10:
* Security 2.0 developer and wire APIs have changed from the Developer Preview
  versions in 15.09 and 16.04
* ASACORE-3353: Codegen'ed apps cannot interop with non-codegen'ed apps. An
  application that introspects and finds multiple annotations that are dependent
  on ordering (e.g., org.allJoyn.Bus.Struct.*) based on AllJoyn 16.04 should
  treat these annotations as unusable. To determine the AllJoyn framework
  version, an application can query the About data.  This was fixed in 16.10.
